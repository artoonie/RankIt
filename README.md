# RankIt

## Overview

**Ranked choice voting is a simple idea.** There are complexities and nuances to discuss beneath the surface, of course, 
but *at* the surface the basic idea is very easy to understand, and even a very basic understanding makes much of why it 
can work so well as a collective decision-making mechanism intuitively apparent. The purpose of this project is to 
communicate that simple idea, hopefully in a way that leaves the user with that intuition. 

Our application allows users to experience ranked choice voting in a hands-on way from several angles. Given our emphasis
on communicating the simplicity and elegance of the idea of RCV, it is imperative that **simplicity and elegance is embodied 
in the look, feel and behavior of the application**, and this need will be reflected in our design and execution of each 
of its interfaces. At the same time, we want to satisfy a range of use cases that will demand a significant degree of 
explorability, discoverability, and customizability in different parts of the application: This theme of simplicity at 
the surface underlain by a depth of capability beneath will recur in many of our interfaces:
